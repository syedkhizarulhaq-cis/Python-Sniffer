# Python-Sniffer

A python sniffer capable of sniffing packets and printing the information out on a txt file.

Pls Note that i have tried running this source code on Windows 10 and it doesn't work due to some socket permissions being not given
by the native OS. So, I tried Linux and works fine on linux.

IDE used: Pycharm
libraries used : socket,struct,sys

If you are looking to sniff out NXDOMAIN packets i recommend using the dns toolkit library in python  :) 

Thanks.

p.s. I used Kali Linux to run and develop this code but i'm pretty sure it will work just fine with any other distribution of linux 
as well!
